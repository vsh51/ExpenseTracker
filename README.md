## Why flask?
When it comes to developing web applications, choosing the right framework is crucial. For the ExpenseTracker, the decision to build it on Flask, a flexible Python web framework, was driven by several key factors.
- Simplicity and Minimalism:
One of the primary reasons for selecting Flask was its simplicity and minimalistic approach. Flask provides just what is necessary to build a web application without unnecessary bloat.
- Developer-Friendly:
Flask's design philosophy aligns perfectly with the principles of Python, making it a natural choice for developers familiar with the language. As the language and fraemwork are simple, developer spends more time on providing solutions, rather than just messing up with annoying punctuational stuff.
- Jinja Templating and Frontend Flexibility:
Flask's default templating engine, Jinja, simplifies the process of generating dynamic HTML content. With Jinja, developers can easily separate logic from presentation, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code.
- Performance:
The lightweight nature of Flask makes it suitable for applications of varying sizes, from small personal projects to large-scale deployments.
